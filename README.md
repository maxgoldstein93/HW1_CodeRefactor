# HW1_CodeRefactor

This assignment is for a Marketing agency that wanted there codebase to follow accessibilty standards so that the companie's own website is optimized for search engines.

In order to get the source code you are going to make a clone of the repository on gitlab and save it to a folder somewhere on your computer. To push the code you will first make a repository on Github that has a readme.md file that initized when open.

The goal of this assignment was to go through an HTML file and a CSS file and meet the accessibility standards. This was accomplished by using semantic HTML elements, following HTML structure, adding alt attributes to all images, checking  heading attributes and creating a descriptitive title.

To make the CSS more accesible to other people viewing it I organized it by sections. All the code that could be done in less line if thay shared attributes were combined to be more efficent. All of the original code is still in the CSS file but commented out.
